# Blockchain_Elections_React
v2 Frontend for [Blockchain Elections (v1)](https://github.com/xavierdmello/Blockchain_Elections), built with React & Ethers.js

WIP.

Try it now: https://elections.xavierdmello.com

Or, run it locally (requires [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)):
1. `yarn` to install dependancies
2. `yarn dev` to start server

TODO:
- red/green status lights for elections (green: open, red: closed)
- styling for run/manage/create page
- vote: sort candidates, add rank too
- modularize election title header component
- change header buttons from b to button
